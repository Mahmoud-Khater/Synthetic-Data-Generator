{"labels": 2, "text": "Grabbed these during a flash sale, betting on solid value for weekend errands. Cushioning starts decent but turns stiff by midday. Materials feel flimsy, prone to scuffs after light use. Sizing skews narrow, cramping my toes. Decent look for the cost, yet durability disappoints overall.", "persona": "budget_shopper", "model": "azure_grok_grok-4-fast-reasoning"}
{"labels": 2, "text": "Simple design and light weight make these easy to wear daily. However, the sole feels less sturdy than I prefer, and the sizing runs a bit off, which complicates quick choices. Not bad for basic needs, but I hoped for something more durable and reliable in long-term use.", "persona": "minimalist", "model": "azure_openai_gpt-4.1-mini"}
