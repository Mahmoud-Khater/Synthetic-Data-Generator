The smart cushioning system promised adaptive comfort, yet it felt inconsistent and didn’t provide the expected support during long wear.

Style-wise, they look sleek but don’t justify the premium cost. Overall, the innovation feels more like a gimmick than a meaningful upgrade.

The integration of the fitness tracker was glitchy and often disconnected, which was frustrating. Comfort-wise, the fit was awkward—too narrow for my feet despite ordering my usual size. The materials felt cheap and I doubt the durability will hold up over time, especially at this price point. Style is decent, but not enough to justify the cost or the unreliable tech. If you’re after innovation that actually works, I’d keep looking. These shoes felt more like a prototype than a polished product.",

The sizing runs way too small, and even after ordering a size up, they still felt tight and pinched my toes. The material feels cheap and started peeling after just a few wears. I tried to break them in, but the sole is stiff and doesn’t offer any cushioning, making them painful to walk in. For the price, I expected better quality and fit. Definitely not worth it if you’re looking for something you can just slip on and wear all day. I wouldn’t recommend these at all.",
