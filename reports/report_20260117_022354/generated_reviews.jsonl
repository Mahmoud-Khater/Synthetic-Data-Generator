Their sleek design suits business attire well, but the rigid soles cause discomfort after hours at my desk. Sizing feels overly roomy, leading to slippage.

{"labels": 3, "text": "Wearing these shoes throughout a busy workday, I appreciate the overall comfort and decent support they offer. The leather feels sturdy and professional, which suits the office environment well. However, they could benefit from slightly better cushioning for those extended hours on my feet.
