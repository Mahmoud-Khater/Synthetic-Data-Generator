{"labels": 2, "text": "Navigating endless conference calls and desk dashes in these shoes feels like a gamble. Cushioning holds up for morning rounds, yet the material frays quickly under office carpet wear. Sizing skews narrow, pinching during long shifts.

{"labels": 3, "text": "Slipping these on for my usual errands felt pretty comfy overall. They handled walking the dog and quick grocery trips well, though the soles could use a bit more grip on slick floors. The look pairs nicely with jeans, and they seem sturdy enough to last through casual wear. Just wish the toe area had a touch more room during longer walks.", "persona": "casual_buyer", "model": "azure_openai_gpt-4.1-mini"}
